ExceptionBase.NET-GTKSharp
========================

This is an unofficial fork of leolabs' ExceptionBase.NET module to use it on Linux, too ;)
The fork uses GTK# to display the dialog. 
At any other point, you can use it like the "original", but you have to use the Gdk.Pixbuf class instead of the Image class.
